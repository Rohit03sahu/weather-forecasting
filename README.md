# weather-forecasting

**Problem Statement**

**Introduction**
The following technical test aims to assess the candidateâ€™s approach to software development. It requires scaffolding an application in .NET and React that allows a user to retrieve weather forecast information for more than one location.

**Requirements**
The candidate is expected to spend no longer than 3 hours on the technical test. Incomplete tests can be a valid submission and will be evaluated based on approach and coding standards rather than the completion of the task. Please create a new repository on GitHub and share the results of your work. The program should be written in .NET and React. Remember to create an initial commit when you begin and commit often so we can see how you work.

**Outputs**
UI that allows a user to search and select two locations.
Given the locations, authenticate and integrate to a free weather API and return the next 7 days' weather forecast information. We suggest using this API: https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/
The program should calculate and return the temperature in both Celcius and Farenheit.
The UI should calculate the average temperature high and low for each location.
The UI should calcuate the delta between the 2 locations for all 7 days and the average.
STRETCH GOAL: add the ability to add more locations: 3, then 4 locations with deltas to the first location.
